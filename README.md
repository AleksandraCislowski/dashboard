An interface in which I show an example representation of various analytical data. You can use the button to change the graphic design from dark to light mode.

Here you can navigate through the different pages to check out some of the charts and tables. In the Profile tab, you can use the login service available from Google to access more profile functionalities. If you do not want to share your data, you can watch a video in which I show what the tab looks like after logging in.
